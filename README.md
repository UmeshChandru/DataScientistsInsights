## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
Default libraries of the Anaconda distribution of Python is sufficient.  
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I am using Stack Overflow data developer survey data from 2016 to 2018 to analyses data scientist job pros and cons. This analysis will explain is it worth to job switch/enter the data scientist role.

As part of this activity, will answer below questions:

* Q1. Data Scientists growth over the period 
* Q2. Gender based data Scientists  population
* Q3. Data Scientists population around the world
* Q4. Data Scientists popular languages
* Q5. Data Scientists job satisfaction
* Q6. Age wise data Scientists average salary 


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

data: This folder contain suvery data in .csv format. Note: due to git size limit files are zipped and uploaded
DataScientistSurvey.ipynb: Jupyter notebook provides the insights of data scientists.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@learnumesh/insights-of-data-scientists-d33e83fa747e).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
